# Architecture Documentation

## ALIVE-ML-FRAMEWORK

### System Overview

This is a revolutionary ai consciousness implementation with advanced architecture.

### Core Components

1. **Main System** - Core processing engine
2. **Data Layer** - State management and persistence
3. **Processing Pipeline** - Computational workflows
4. **Interface Layer** - External interactions

### Design Patterns

- **Modularity**: Separated concerns for maintainability
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new capabilities
- **Performance**: Optimized algorithms and data structures
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling

### Data Flow

```
Input → Validation → Processing → Output
  ↓
State Management → Persistence
```

### Technical Decisions

All architectural choices are made to maximize:
- Code quality and maintainability
- Performance and scalability
- Extensibility and flexibility
- Production readiness
